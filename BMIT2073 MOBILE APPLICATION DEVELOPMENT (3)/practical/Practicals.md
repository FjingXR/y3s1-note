Introduction

Welcome to BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development course this semester. Get ready to embark
on  an  existing  and  practical  journey  into  the  world  of  creating  mobile  applications.  This  set  of
practical sessions are created using the following tools:

●  Android Studio
●  Android SDK Platform
●  Android SDK Build Tools
●  Flutter
●  Dart

The official Flutter website is your primary and most reliable source for learning Flutter and finding
help.

Learn Flutter (docs.flutter.dev/get-started/learn-flutter): This section is specifically designed for new
Flutter developers and provides a structured path to learn the fundamentals.

●  Dart language overview: Since Flutter uses Dart, it's recommended to have a basic

understanding of the language. The documentation offers an overview for those with
experience in other object-oriented languages.

●  Write your first Flutter app (Codelab): This interactive tutorial walks you through creating a

simple Flutter application for mobile, desktop, and web.

●  Learn the fundamentals: This section guides you through the most important aspects of

building Flutter applications.

Flutter Cookbook (docs.flutter.dev/cookbook): This is a fantastic resource with "recipes" that
demonstrate how to solve common problems in Flutter apps. It covers various topics like:

●  Animation
●  Design (e.g., adding drawers, snackbars, custom fonts, themes)
●  Forms and Gestures (e.g., form validation, handling taps)
●  Navigation & Routing
●  Accessing device APIs (e.g., camera, gallery)
●  Networking and Data Persistence
●  Testing (unit, widget, integration)

Widget Catalog: Flutter's UI is built with widgets. The documentation has a comprehensive catalog of
all available widgets, their properties, and examples of how to use them.

FAQ (docs.flutter.dev/resources/faq): Provides answers to frequently asked questions about Flutter,
its capabilities, technology, and more.

Samples (github.com/flutter/samples): The official GitHub repository for Flutter contains a wide

A crucial aspect of this course is our practical lab sessions. We will provide you with code snippets
and examples to help you understand core concepts. We strongly urge you to focus on observing and
understanding the functionality of the code provided, rather than simply copying and pasting.

Furthermore, towards the end of each lab session, you will find a "TODO" item. These are tasks
designed for you to complete independently, applying the concepts learned during the lab.

Practical 1:

Setup Flutter Development Environment

Flutter  is  Google's  UI  toolkit  for  building  applications  for  mobile,  web,  and  desktop  from  a  single
codebase.  In  this  practical,  you  will  install  the  necessary  files  and  build  the  following  Flutter
application:

1.  Download the following installation files:

a.  Flutter SDK (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
b.  Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio)
c.  Git [Optional] (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
d.  Node.Js [Optional] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)

2.  Extra the Flutter SDK to a local drive. E.g. C:\flutter\

3.

Install Android Studio.

4.  Launch Android Studio and install the following components:

Version: 202605

Package

Module

Skeleton

FFI Plugin

To create reusable code modules that can be shared across multiple
Flutter projects or published to pub.dev (Flutter's package
repository).

Creates a reusable Flutter module that can be integrated as a
dependency into other Flutter projects.

A simplified project with minimal boilerplate code.

To interact with native libraries (C, C++, etc.) using the Foreign
Function Interface (FFI) in Dart.

Empty Project

Creates a completely empty project with no default files or
structure.

11. For this practical we select an Empty Project type.

12. Once the project is ready you will see the screen as follows: -

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

13. Click the Device Manager (

) on the right panel and press the Run (

) button.

However, If you do not see any device in the Device Manager, you may click the Add a new
device  (
)  button  and  click  Create  Virtual  Device.  Select  a  device  definition from the list
and click the Next button.

Then, select a system image and click the Next button.

Enter a name in the AVD (Android Virtual Device) and click the Finish button.

Page 10 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

The newly created AVD should appear in the Device Manager.

14. On the top of the screen, press the Run (

) button. Running the app for the first time will

take a long time depending on the quality of the network.

15. You will see the running device as follows: -

Page 11 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

16. The app run as follows: -

In the Running Devices tab (
associated with a mobile device such as On/Off button, volume up/down, etc.

), examine the top panel that has a list of common functions

17. At the bottom left of the screen, click the Run tab (

), which shows the console messages.
When you build your app (compile it into an APK or bundle), the console shows the progress
of the build process, any warnings or errors encountered, and the final build results.

This  panel  also  shows  the  logcat  output.  This  is  crucial  for  debugging.  It  displays  system
messages, application logs, and any errors or exceptions thrown by your app while running.

Page 12 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

18. The project File Explorer is on the left. It lists all the platforms supported by your project.

19. Expand  the  lib  folder.  This  folder  contains  Dart  program  files  for  your  project.  Open  and
examine  the  main.dart  file  and  enter  the  following  comments  so that you understand the
purposes of these commands:

//Importing the necessary packages
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

//The entry point of the Flutter application.
void main() {
  //A function that takes a Widget as an argument and renders it on the screen.
  runApp(const MainApp());
}

//Declaring a stateless widget class that does not change its state over time
class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MainApp({super.key}); //Constructor of this widget

  //The build function is responsible for building the widget's UI
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    //It returns a MaterialApp widget
    return const MaterialApp(

//A basic layout structure consisting an app bar, a body and drawers

      home: Scaffold(
        //A layout widget that centres its child within its available space
        body: Center(
           child: Text('Hello World!'), //A text widget
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

Next, let us edit the program code further to change the UI.

Page 13 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

20. Mouse over the Scaffold widget to observe its attributes. You may scroll down to see all

attributes and a short description about the widget.

21. Within the Scaffold widget, enter the text app, the editor will find and show a matching

attribute, press the Tab key to accept the suggested attribute.

22. Enter the following code (ignore the error at the moment):

23. If there is an error in your code, the editor might have solutions to fix it. Click any part of the
)  to  see  the  possible  fixes.  Select  Remove

error  code  and  then  click  the  red  light  bulb  (
const as a fix.

As  suggested  by the editor, the command const (it means constant) shall be removed from
the  MaterialApp  widget  after  inserting  the  AppBar.  The  error  arises  because  the  AppBar
widget within the Scaffold is not a constant constructor.

Page 14 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

After applying the fix your code shall look like this:

24. Save the program code (Ctrl+S) and observe the app bar. Flutter supports hot reload;
therefore, you should see the UI changes without the need to relaunch your app.

25. At the moment, the Center widget can only hold one child widget. We need another widget
that can hold multiple children. Mouse click on the Text widget, then click on the yellow light
bulb  (
)  on  the  right.  You  will  see  a  drop-down  list,  select  Wrap  with  Column.  You  can
preview each selection on the right of each option.

26. The result will be as follows: -

Column  is  a  widget  that  can  contain  multiple  widgets  within  the  array  attribute  named
children.

27. Save your work and view the UI. Now, the Text widget is the only child under the Column

widget.

Page 15 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

28. Modify the Column widget so that all the children widgets are aligned to the centre of the

screen as follows: -

child: Column(
  //A text widget
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    Text('Hello World!'),
  ],
), //A text widget

Save your work and observe the result.

29. Modify the existing Text widget. Also insert two TextField widgets to allow users to enter

text.

Text('Login'),
TextField(
  keyboardType: TextInputType.name,
  decoration: const InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Username',
    border: OutlineInputBorder(),
  ),
),
TextField(
  keyboardType: TextInputType.text,
  obscureText: true,
  decoration: const InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Password',
    border: OutlineInputBorder(),
  ),
),

30. Insert another two ElevatedButton widgets:

ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: (){}, //Empty event handler
    child: Text('Login'),
),
ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: (){}, //Empty event handler
    child: Text('Register'),
),

Congratulations! You have completed your first Flutter app!

Remarks:

If you are unable to deploy a Flutter app in Android, do check the Gradle compatibility matrix at
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html

For Kotlin version 1.8, the minimum Gradle version is 8.0 with JVM between 8 and 23. JVM 24 and
later versions are not yet supported.

Practical 2:

Setting up Version Control System

Version  control,  also  known  as  source  control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to
software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes
to source code over time.

Android  Studio  supports  a  variety  of  version  control  systems  (VCSs),  including  Git,  GitHub,  CVS,
Mercurial, Subversion, and Google Cloud Source Repositories.

1.  Download and install Git. (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2.  Open  the  Git  Command  or  Windows  Command-prompt  or  Android  Studio  command

prompt, enter the following commands:
git config --global user.name "Your GitHub ID"
git config --global user.email "Your Email Address"

Confirm that you have set the Git username correctly, enter the command:

git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

And you shall see your name:

> Your name here
> Your email here

3.  Register a new GitHub student account. (https://education.github.com/pack)

Practical 3:

Inputs and Outputs

This  lab focuses on getting inputs from the user, performing some computations and displaying the
outputs. We will build a simple mobile app to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI). It is a handy tool
for measuring overweight and obesity. It can be calculated with your weight and height. In a gist, BMI
is a good indicator for diagnosing body fat percentage and potential diseases.

The formula for BMI calculation is as follows: -

BMI = weight / (height in meters) 2

BMI values and types are as follows: -

BMI

Underweight

Normal

Overweight

Value

Below 18.5

18.5 – 24.9

More than 25

Sample outputs of the app are as follows: -

Page 25 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

1.  Create a new Application project. Set the project title to bmi.

2.

In the project File Explorer, right click on the root of the folder and select New -> Directory.

3.  Name  the  new  directory  assets.  The  assets  directory  is  dedicated  for  you  to  store  static
resources (images, audios, videos, fonts, JSONs, etc) that your app needs to function. These
resources are then bundled with your app during the build process and become accessible at
runtime.

4.  Repeat step 2, within the assets directory, create a new sub-directory named images. We will

place several images into this folder.

5.  Copy  and  paste  the  four  image  files  that  represent  BMI  status  into  the  assets/images/
directory.  When  you  paste  the  image  files  into  the  project  File  Explorer,  the  editor  will
prompt the following: -

Click the Refactor button to continue.

Page 26 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

6.  After that, the four image files should appear in the directory.

7.

In the project File Explorer, open the pubspec.yaml file. Then scroll to the flutter: section.
You are to insert a sub-section named assets:

Below  the  assets: section, insert – assets/images/. This ensures the app can bundle all the
images in this directory.

8.  Open the main.dart file, at the beginning of the file, insert the following code:

import 'dart:math';

The import statement is to make code from external libraries accessible within your current
file.  In  this  case,  we  will  use  the  power  function  (pow).  Usually,  the  editor  will  insert
unambiguous libraries automatically.

9.  Within

the
TextEditingControllers.

class  _MyHomePageState,  we  declare

some

local  variables  and

//TODO 2: Declare local variable
double _bmi = 0.0;
double _weight = 0.0;
double _height = 0.0;

String _bmiOutput='';
String _bmiImage = 'assets/images/empty.png';

final TextEditingController _weightCtrl = TextEditingController();
final TextEditingController _heightCtrl = TextEditingController();

The TextEditingController is a class that manages the text input within a TextField widget. It
can get from and set text to a TextField.

Page 27 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

10. Insert the _calculateBMI() function to get user inputs and calculate the value of BMI.

//TODO 3: Calculate BMI value
void _calculateBMI() {

  _weight = double.tryParse(_weightCtrl.text)!;
  _height = double.tryParse(_heightCtrl.text)!;

  setState(() {
    _bmi = _weight / pow(_height, 2);

    if (_bmi < 18.5) {
      _bmiImage = 'assets/images/under.png';
      _bmiOutput = '${_bmi.toStringAsFixed(2)} [Underweight]';
    }else if(_bmi >=25 ){
      _bmiImage = 'assets/images/over.png';
      _bmiOutput = '${_bmi.toStringAsFixed(2)} [Overweight]';
    }else{
      _bmiImage = 'assets/images/normal.png';
      _bmiOutput = '${_bmi.toStringAsFixed(2)} [Normal]';
    }
  });
}

11. Next, insert a function named _resetScreen to reset state all widgets.

//TODO 4: Reset all widgets
void _resetScreen(){
  _weightCtrl.clear();
  _heightCtrl.clear();
  setState(() {
    _bmi = 0.0;
    _bmiOutput = '';
    _bmiImage = 'assets/images/empty.png';
  });
}

The  setState()  method  is  crucial  for  updating  the  UI  in  a  stateful  widget.  When  you  call
setState(), it tells Flutter that the widget's state has changed.

12. Within  the  _MyHomePageState,  override  the  dispose  method.  You may override any class

method by typing @o and then select the dispose method.

All  TextEditingController  should  be  disposed  within  the  dispose  method.  The  dispose
method  is  called  when  the  user is leaving your app. Controllers hold references to the text

Page 28 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

they manage. Dispose these controllers avoid memory leaks, which can prevent performance
issues or even app crashes.

Complete the following codes:
//TODO 5: Override the dispose method
@override
 void dispose() {
   super.dispose();
   _weightCtrl.dispose();
   _heightCtrl.dispose();
}

13. Within the Scaffold widget, insert a new attribute named resizeToAvoidBottomInset and set

it to false.

return Scaffold(
  //TODO 6: set resize of screen to avoid overflow issue
  resizeToAvoidBottomInset: false,
  appBar: AppBar(
    backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
    title: Text(widget.title),
  ),

14. Wrap  the  Column  widget with a Padding widget, which adds empty space around its child.

Within the Padding widget:

body: Center(
  //TODO 7: Insert a Padding widget
  child: Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
    child: Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: <Widget>[
            …

15. Within the children of the Column widget, insert a Stack widget.

//TODO 8: Insert Stack with image and text
Stack(
  fit: StackFit.loose,
  alignment: AlignmentDirectional.center,
  children: [
   //TODO 9: Insert two containers

     ],
),

16. Within the Stack widget, insert two Container widgets. The first container holds an Image

widget that represents the BMI status.

    Container(
      width: 160,
      height: 160,
      decoration: BoxDecoration(
        border: Border.all(
          color: Colors.orange,
          width: 3,
        ),
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.0),

Page 29 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

      ),
      child: Image.asset(
        _bmiImage,
      ),
    ),

The second container holds a Text widget that displays instructions guiding users on how to
operate the app.

    Container(
      width: 150,
      height: 150,
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      child: _bmi==0.0 ? Text(
        textAlign: TextAlign.center,
        'Enter body weight and height to know your Body Mass Index (BMI)',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 12, color: Colors.orange, ),
      ): Text(''),
    ),

Notice  that  the  second  Text  widget  displays  text  conditionally  based  on  the  value  of  a
variable named _bmi. In this case, the code displays a message prompting the user to enter
their weight and height. Once the user enters the values and the BMI is calculated, _bmi will
no  longer  be  0.0,  and  the  empty  Text widget will be displayed, effectively hiding the initial
message. Save and run your app, you should see the following outputs:

17. Continue to insert two Text widgets. These are to display BMI value and the status.

//TODO 10: Insert text widget showing BMI status
const Text(
  'You Body Mass Index (BMI) is :',
),
Text(
  _bmiOutput,
  style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.displaySmall,
),

18. Continue to insert two TextField widgets, which are to capture inputs from the user.

//TODO 11: Insert TextField and Button
TextField(
  controller: _weightCtrl,
  keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Enter weight (kg)',
  ),
),
TextField(
  controller: _heightCtrl,
  keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
  decoration: InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Enter height (meter)',
  ),

Setting the keyboardType to TextInputType.number within the TextField widget restricts the
user input to numbers.

19. Insert an Expanded widget that takes up empty screen spaces and pushes the subsequent

widget to the bottom of the screen.

//TODO 12: Insert an Expanded widget to take up empty screen spaces
Expanded(child: SizedBox(height: double.infinity,)),

20. Finally, insert a Row widget, which has two buttons. The Row widget is used to arrange the

buttons horizontally.

//TODO 13: Insert reset and calculate buttons
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: _resetScreen, child: Text('Reset')),
    ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: _calculateBMI, child: Text('Calculate')),
  ],
),

Save and run your app.

TODO: Enhance the app by including input validation. Implement range field validation,
ensuring that input falls within an acceptable range of values (e.g. age between 0 and
100).

Practical 4:

Navigation

We will learn the basic of Flutter navigation in this practical. It allows us to move from one screen to
another. Also, we will pass a piece of data from the first screen to the second screen.

We  will  enhance  the  BMI  calculator  with  a  new  Information  screen,  showing  a  short  description
about  BMI,  the  formula to calculate it, and a list of BMI values. Also, we will pass the value of BMI
from the main to the information screen.

1.  Open the BMI project.

2.  Modify the main.dart file. Insert a new IconButton below the Expanded widget:

//TODO 12: Insert an Expanded widget to take up empty screen spaces
Expanded(child: SizedBox(height: double.infinity,)),

IconButton(
  icon: Icon(Icons.info),
  iconSize: 48,
  color: Colors.orangeAccent,
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.push(
        context,
        MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => Info(bmi: _bmiOutput,)));
  },
),

3.  Right-click  on  the  lib  folder,  select  New  -> Dart File. Assign the name info.dart to the new

file.

Page 32 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

4.  Within  the  info.dart  file,  enter  stl  and  the  system  will  prompt  you a list of widgets, select
stless  to  create  a  new  Stateless  widget.  We  will  not  implement  any  UI  update  here,
therefore, a Stateless widget is appropriate.

Assign Info as the name of the newly created stateless widget:

5.

Import the following package:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

6.  Within  the  Info class, define a local variable named bmi to hold the BMI data passing from
the  first  screen.  Also,  modify  the  Info  constructor  to  include  the  bmi  value  as  a  required
value.

class Info extends StatelessWidget {
  //TODO 1: Define a local variable to accept value
  final String bmi;
  const Info({super.key, required this.bmi});

7.  Replace  the  Placeholder  widget  with  a  Scaffold  widget.  Also,  assign  a  Text  to  the  widget

showing the heading text.

//TODO 2: Replace the Placeholder with a Scaffold
return Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    title: const Text('Body Mass Index Info'),
  ),

8.  Within the body of the Scaffold, insert a Padding, a Center, and a Column widget.

//TODO 3: Insert Padding, Center, and Column
body: Padding(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
  child: Center(
    child: Column(
      children: [],
    ), //Column
  ), //Center
), //Padding

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

9.

Inside the children of the Column, insert the following widgets:
a.  A Text widget to show the general description of BMI.

Text('Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of
a person.\n\nThe BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body
height, and is expressed in units of kg/m\u00B2, resulting from mass in kilograms
(kg) and height in metres (m).'),

b.  A Table widget to show BMI value and classification.

Table(
  border: TableBorder.all(color: Colors.orangeAccent),
  //defaultVerticalAlignment: TableCellVerticalAlignment.middle,
  children: const [
    TableRow(
      children: [
        TableCell(child: Text('BMI Value',

textAlign: TextAlign.center,
style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),)),

        TableCell(child: Text('Classification',

textAlign: TextAlign.center,
style: TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold))),

      ],

  TableRow(
    children: [
      TableCell(child: Center(child: Text('Below 18.5',

textAlign: TextAlign.center,))),

      TableCell(child: Center(child: Text('Underweight',

textAlign: TextAlign.center,))),

    ],
  ),
    //TODO: Continue inserting the remaining two rows.
    ...
  ],
),

c.  A Text widget to show the BMI value received from the first screen.

bmi==''? Text('Please enter your weight and height.'):

Text('You Body Mass Index (BMI) is : $bmi',),

d.  An Expanded widget.

Expanded(child: SizedBox()),

e.  A ElevatedButton widget.

ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.pop(context);
  },
  child: const Text('Go back!'),
),

10.  Save and run the project.

TODO: Enhance the app by including a link to a web URL at
https://data.worldobesity.org/country/malaysia-130/

Practical 5:

State Management

State management refers to the management and manipulation of data within an app to ensure that
the user interface (UI) accurately reflects the current state of the application. This lab utilizes the
Provider package, which allows you to hold application’s state.

1.  We are going to create a mobile app that utilizing the Provider state management as below:

      Figure 1 Item List

Figure 2 Cart

1.  Create a new Flutter project using the Application template.

2.  Open the Terminal and enter the following command:

flutter pub add provider

3.  Create a new dart file named item.dart. This is a model for items to be stored in the memory.

class Item{
  int id;
  String name;
  //Constructor with initializing formal parameters
  Item(this.id, this.name);
  int get itemID => id;
  String get itemName => name;
  @override
  String toString() {
    return '$id: $name';
  }
}

Page 35 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

4.  Create a new dart file named cart_provider.dart. This class holds a list of items (the cart) that

could be accessed by all the screens/routes within the app.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'item.dart';

//Providing change notification to its listeners
class CartProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  final List<Item> itemList = [];

  void add(Item item){
    itemList.add(item);
    notifyListeners();
  }

  void remove(Item item){
    itemList.remove(item);
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

5.

In the main.dart file, observe the dummy data list as follows: -

final List<Item> catalog = [
  Item(1, 'Shoes'),
  Item(2, 'Hats'),
  Item(3, 'Shirts'),
  Item(4, 'Tie'),
  Item(5, 'Pants'),
  Item(6, 'Jeans'),
  Item(7, 'Shorts'),
  Item(8, 'Underwear'),
  Item(9, 'Jumpers'),
  Item(10, 'Trousers'),
  Item(11, 'Sleepwear'),
  Item(12, 'Accessories'),
];

This catalog list should be declared as a global variable, which can be above the main()
function.

6.

In the main.dart file, update the main() function to include an instance of a ChangeNotifer as
follows:-

void main() {
  //TODO - The ChangeNotifierProvider provides an instance of a ChangeNotifier to
its descendants
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => CartProvider(),
      child: const MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}

7.

In the main.dart file, insert a new class named CartItem, which is used to present an item in
a list. Each cart item has an id, name, and an Add button:

Page 36 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

class CartItem extends StatelessWidget {
  final int index;

  const CartItem({super.key, required this.index});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    var item = catalog[index];
    return Row(
      children: [
        //TODO - Insert widgets for each row
        Text('$item'),
        const Expanded(child: SizedBox()),
        Consumer<CartProvider>(builder: (context, cart, child) {
          return TextButton(
              onPressed: () {
                cart.add(item);
                ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
                    SnackBar(
                      content: Text('$item added to cart.'),
                    ),
                );
              },
              child: const Text('Add'));
        }),
      ],
    );
  }

The  body  section  contains  a  Consumer  that  can  access  a  ChangeNotifer  named
CartProvider.

8.  Modify the body section of the build() method of the _MyHomePageState to include a

ListView as follows:-

body: Center(
    child: ListView.separated(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
        scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
        shrinkWrap: true,
        itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
          return CartItem(index: index);
        },
        separatorBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) =>
            const Divider(),
        itemCount: catalog.length
    )
),

9.  Run the project. You should be able to see a ListView as shown in Figure 1 Item List.

10. In  the  main.dart  file,  MyAppState’s  build()  method,  include  an  icon  button  in the appBar

section:

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: const Text('State Management'),

Page 37 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

      actions: [
        IconButton(
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.push<void>(
                context,
                MaterialPageRoute<void>(
                  builder: (BuildContext context) => const CartPage()));
          },
          icon: const Icon(Icons.shopping_cart),
        ),
      ],
    ),

Ignore the error for CartPage(), we will create it later.

11. Create a new dart file named card_dart as follows: -

import 'package:demo_state_mgmt/cart_provider.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';
import 'item.dart';

class CartPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const CartPage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Cart'),
      ),
      body: const Column(
        mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
        children: [
          CartListWidget(),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}

class CartListWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const CartListWidget({super.key});

  @override
  State<CartListWidget> createState() => _CartListWidgetState();
}

class _CartListWidgetState extends State<CartListWidget> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Consumer<CartProvider>(
        builder: (context, cart, child) {
            return cart.itemList.isNotEmpty
            ? ListView.separated(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
              scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
              shrinkWrap: true,
              itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index){
                return CartItem(item: cart.itemList[index]);
              },
              itemCount: cart.itemList.length,
              separatorBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) => const
Divider(),

Page 38 of 85

Version: 202605

            )
            : const Center(child: Text('Cart is empty.'));
        }
    );
  }
}

class CartItem extends StatelessWidget {
  final Item item;

  const CartItem({super.key, required this.item});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Row(
      children: [
        Text('$item'),
        const Expanded(child: SizedBox()),
        TextButton(
            onPressed: () {
              Provider.of<CartProvider>(context, listen: false).remove(item);
            },
            child: const Text('Remove')),
      ],
    );
  }
}

This widget is similar to the main.dart’s MyApp() widget, however, the item list has a remove
button.

12. Save and run the project. Try adding some items to the shopping list and then click the cart

button.

TODO: Enhance the app by including a cart item counter displayed at the menu bar.

Practical 6:

Form and Input Validation

The  Form  widget  in  Flutter  is  a  fundamental  widget  for  building forms. It provides a way to group
multiple  form  fields  together,  perform  validation  on  those  fields,  and  manage  their  state. This lab
demonstrates the use of TextFormField, Checkbox, RadioList, and DropdownButton widgets. We will
create a car loan calculator.

Formulas given are as follows: -

Interest = loan amount * (interest rate/100) * loan period

a.
b.  Repayment amount = (loan amount + interest) / (loan period * 12 months)

For example, if the loan amount is RM 45,000 with an interest rate of 3.2% for 5 years.

Interest = 3.2% x RM 45,000 x 5 years = RM 7,200
Repayment amount = (RM 45,000 + RM 7,200) / (5 years X 12 months) = RM 870

If  the  repayment  amount  is  more  than  30%  of  a  person's  net  income,  then  the  loan  application
should be rejected, unless the person has a guarantor.

1.  Create  a  new  Flutter  project  type  Application  name  car_loan.  Set  the  package  name  to

my.edu.tarc.

2.  Open

the

terminal  window  and  enter  the

following  command  to

include  the

internationalization package:

flutter pub add flutter_localizations --sdk=flutter
flutter pub add intl:any

Page 40 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

3.  Open the main.dart file and include the following package:

import 'package:intl/intl.dart' as intl;

4.  Change the title attribute of MaterialApp and MyHomePage to ‘Car Loan’.

5.  Within the _MyHomePageState class, declare some controllers and local variables:

//Declare local variables
double _loanAmount = 0.0;
double _netIncome = 0.0;
double _interestRate = 0.0;
int _loanPeriod = 1;
bool _hasGuarantor = false;
int _carType = 1; //1 = New, 2 = Used
double _repaymentAmount = 0.0;
String _repaymentOutput = '';
final _years = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9];

//Controller
final loanAmountCtrl = TextEditingController();
final netIncomeCtrl = TextEditingController();
final interestRateCtrl = TextEditingController();
//Set focus to a specific widget
final _myFocusNode = FocusNode();

//Format output with the currency symbol of Malaysia
final myCurrency = intl.NumberFormat('#,##0.00', 'ms_MY');

//Form controller - manages the overall form state
final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();

The _formKey is used to access the FormState object, which allows you to validate and save
the form.

6.  The app shall prompt a simple dialog if the user is not eligible for a car loan. Continue in the

_MyHomePageState class, we create a method to show the dialog:

void myAlertDialog(){
  AlertDialog eligibilityAlertDialog = AlertDialog(
    title: const Text('Eligibility'),
    content: const Text('You are not eligible for this loan. '
        'Get a guarantor to proceed'),
    actions: [
      TextButton(
          onPressed: (){
            Navigator.pop(context);
          },
          child: const Text('Ok')),
    ],
  );
  showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context){
        return eligibilityAlertDialog;
      });
}

Page 41 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

7.  Within the _MyHomePageState class, create a method to calculate the repayment amount:

void _calculateRepayment(){
  _loanAmount = double.parse(loanAmountCtrl.text);
  _netIncome = double.parse(netIncomeCtrl.text);
  _interestRate = double.parse(interestRateCtrl.text);
  var interest = _loanAmount * _loanPeriod * (_interestRate/100);
  _repaymentAmount = (_loanAmount + interest) / (_loanPeriod * 12);
  bool eligible = _netIncome * 0.3 >= _repaymentAmount;
  if(eligible || _hasGuarantor){
    setState(() {
      _repaymentOutput = 'Repayment Amount : '
          '${myCurrency.currencySymbol} '
          '${myCurrency.format(_repaymentAmount)} '
          '\n '
          'Eligibility : ${eligible? 'Eligible': 'Not Eligible'}';
    });
  }else{
    myAlertDialog();
  }
}

8.  You may remove the following codes from the program:

int _counter = 0;

void _incrementCounter() {
  setState(() {
    _counter++;
  });
}

Also, you may remove the FloatingActionButton.

9.

In  the  build  function  of  _MyHomePageState  class,  wrap  the  Center  widget  with  a  Form
widget. Assign _formKey to the key attribute.

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
      title: Text(widget.title),
    ),
    body: Form(
      key: _formKey,
      child: Center(
        child: Column(

 …

10. Within the children of the Column widget, define two TextFormField widgets.

TextFormField(
  decoration: const InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Loan Amount',
  ),
  keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
  inputFormatters: [FilteringTextInputFormatter.digitsOnly],
  controller: loanAmountCtrl,
  focusNode: _myFocusNode,
  validator: (value){
    if(value == null || value.isEmpty){
      return 'Please enter loan amount';

Page 42 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

    }
    return null;
  },
),
TextFormField(
  decoration: const InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Net Income',
  ),
  keyboardType: TextInputType.number,
  inputFormatters: [FilteringTextInputFormatter.digitsOnly],
  controller: netIncomeCtrl,
  validator: (value){
    if(value == null || value.isEmpty){
      return 'Please enter net income';
    }
    return null;
  },
),

Notice  that  each  TextFormField  widget  has  a  validator.  This function checks if the input is
valid. If the input is invalid, it returns an error message. If the input is valid, it returns null.

11. Continue with UI with a DropdownButtonFormField widget.

DropdownButtonFormField(
    value: _loanPeriod,
    items: _years.map((int item){
      return DropdownMenuItem(
        value: item,
        child: Text('$item year(s)'),
      );
    }).toList(),
    onChanged: (int? item){
      setState(() {
        _loanPeriod = item!;
      });
    },
  validator: (value){
      if(value == 0){
        return 'Please select an option';
      }
      return null;
  },
  decoration: const InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Select loan period (year)'
  ),
),

12. Next, insert a TextFormField to accept the interest rate.

TextFormField(
  keyboardType: const TextInputType.numberWithOptions(
    decimal: true,
    signed: false
  ),
  inputFormatters: [
    FilteringTextInputFormatter.allow(RegExp(r'[0-9.]'))
  ],
  decoration: const InputDecoration(
    labelText: 'Interest Rate (%)'
  ),
  controller: interestRateCtrl,
  validator: (value){

Page 43 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

    if(value == null || value.isEmpty){
      return 'Please enter interest rate';
    }
    return null;
  },
),

This field applies a regular expression, which ensure the interest rate is in the right format. Find
out more about Regular Expression here:
https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/RegExp-class.html

13. We also insert a CheckBoxTitle widget for the user to indicate the status of guarantor.

CheckboxListTile(
    value: _hasGuarantor,
    title: const Text('I have a guarantor'),
    onChanged: (value) {
      setState(() {
        _hasGuarantor = value!;
      });
    }),

14. Next, insert a Text and two RadioListTile widgets.

const Align(
  alignment: Alignment.centerLeft,
  child: Text('Car Type', textDirection: TextDirection.ltr,),
),
RadioListTile(
    title: const Text('New'),
    value: 1, //New car
    groupValue: _carType,
    onChanged: (value){
      setState(() {
        _carType = value!;
      });
    }),
RadioListTile(
    title: const Text('Used'),
    value: 2, //Used car
    groupValue: _carType,
    onChanged: (value){
      setState(() {
        _carType = value!;
      });
    }),

For the two RadioListTile to act as a cohesive group, all widgets should be assigned the same
groupValue, but each widget should be assigned with a unique value.

15. Insert a Text and an ElevatedButton widgets.

// Display repayment amount
Text(_repaymentOutput),

ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () {
      // Validate returns true if the form is valid, or false otherwise.
      if(_formKey.currentState!.validate()){
Page 44 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

        // If the form is valid
        if(validInterest(_carType)){
          _calculateRepayment();
        }else{
          ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
              const SnackBar(content: Text('Invalid interest rate'),)
          );
        }
      }
    },
    child: const Text('Calculate')
),

16. Finally, override the dispose method.

@override void dispose() {
  // TODO: implement dispose
  super.dispose();
  loanAmountCtrl.dispose();
  netIncomeCtrl.dispose();
  interestRateCtrl.dispose();
}

When the Form widget is disposed of, the form state is also disposed of, and any associated
resources are released. Since Form is a widget, we do not need to dispose the validator.

TODO: Assume that for new cars, you can get a fixed interest rate of 2.5% to 3.2% p.a.
Used cars, on the other hand, come with an interest rate of 3.2% to 4.45% p.a.
Implement the necessary input validation.

Shared Preferences

Practical 7:
1.  Create  a  new  Flutter  project type Application name user_profile. Set the package name to
my.edu.tarc. This app utilises the shared_preferences library to store key-value pairs in local
storage. For this case, we will save name and email address of a user as shown below:

2.  Open a new Terminal and enter the following command:

flutter pub add shared_preferences

3.  Open the main.dart file and import the shared_preferences.dart file:

//TODO 1: - Import reference to async and shared_preferences
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

4.

In the class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage>, insert TextEditingController
for the two TextField widgets in the class:

//TODO 2: - Insert TextEditingController
final _nameTextEditingController = TextEditingController();
final _emailTextEditingController = TextEditingController();

5.  Within the class class SharedPreferencesDemoState extends

State<SharedPreferencesDemo>, insert to asynchronies functions as follows: -

Data File

This  app  allows  users  to  pick  an  image  from  the  Gallery  and save it as a profile picture in a folder
dedicated to the app. This app utilizes the image picker and file Input/Output operations.

1.  Create a new Flutter app using the Application template.

       Default profile picture

Note: Download a profile image and insert it to the assets folder of your app.

2.

In  the  project  File  Explorer,  open  the
Android’smanifest file.

Insert  the  following  permission

into  the

Page 49 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>

3.

In the terminal, run the following command

flutter pub add image_picker path_provider

4.  Open the main.dart file. Import the following packages:

import 'package:image_picker/image_picker.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';

5.  Within the stateful widget, declare a file and an image picker instance:

//TODO - Create a file and an image picker instances
File? _image;
final picker = ImagePicker();

6.  Create a method to obtain an image file from the Gallery:

//TODO - Obtain profile image from the Gallery
Future getImageFromGallery() async {
  final pickedFile = await picker.pickImage(source: ImageSource.gallery);

  if (pickedFile != null) {
    setState(() {
      _image = File(pickedFile.path);
    });
  }
}

7.  Create a method to save the profile image into the app folder:

//TODO - Save the profile image into the app folder
Future<void> savePicture() async {
  if (_image != null) {
    try {
      // Save the image to a specific location
      final appDocDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
      final newImagePath = '${appDocDir.path}/profile.png';
      await _image!.copy(newImagePath);
      print('File image copied successfully to $newImagePath');
    } catch (e) {
      print('File error copying image: $e');
    }
  } else {
    AlertDialog(
      title: const Text('Profile Image'),
      content: const SingleChildScrollView(
        child: ListBody(
          children: <Widget>[
            Text('Profile Image'),
            Text('Profile Image file is missing.'),

          ],
        ),
      ),
      actions: <Widget>[
        TextButton(
          child: const Text('Close'),
          onPressed: () {
            Navigator.of(context).pop();
          },
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}

8.  Create a method to load the profile image:

//TODO - Load profile image from the app folder
Future<void> loadProfileImage() async {
  // Get the application documents directory
  final appDocDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  final imagePath = '${appDocDir.path}/profile.png';

  // Create the destination file path
  final file = File(imagePath);

  if (await file.exists()) {
    setState(() {
      _image = file;
      print('File path: $imagePath');
    });
  } else {
    print('File not found in $imagePath');
  }
}

9.  Call the loadProfileImage method in the initState method:

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  //TODO - Call the loadProfileImage method during app initialization stage
  loadProfileImage();
}

10. Construct the main UI:

//TODO - Construct the main UI
_image == null
    ? Image.asset(
        'assets/profile.png',
        width: 150,
        height: 150,
      )
    : Image.file(
        _image!,
        width: 150,
        height: 150,
      ),
const SizedBox(height: 8.0,),
IconButton(

  icon: const Icon(Icons.edit),
  color: Colors.grey,
  onPressed: () {
    getImageFromGallery();
  },
),
const SizedBox(height: 8.0,),
ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () {
      savePicture();
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
          const SnackBar(content: Text('Profile image saved.')));
    },
    child: const Text('Save'),
),

11. Run the app. Pick an image from the Gallery and hit the Save button.

12. Click the menu View -> Tool Windows -> Device Explorer. Expand the folder data -> data >-
<your_app_package_name> -> app_flutter, you should be able to find the image file named
profile.png. Congratulations! You have completed this practical.

Practical 9:
1.  Create a new Flutter app using the Application template. It is a mood journal app allowing

SQLite

users to perform emotion tracking.

2.

In the Terminal, add the following dependencies:

flutter pub add sqflite

flutter pub add uuid

flutter pub add path_provider

3.

Insert a new dart file named mood_model.dart. This is a model class to perform CRUD
operations of mood records.

class MoodModel{
  final int id;
  final int scale;
  final String description;
  final String createdOn;

  MoodModel({
    required this.id,
    required this.scale,
    required this.description,
    required this.createdOn,
  });

  factory MoodModel.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic>data) => MoodModel(
      id: data['id'],
      scale: data['scale'],
      description: data['description'],
      createdOn: data['createdOn'],
  );

  Map<String, dynamic> toMap() => {
    'id': id,
    'scale': scale,
    'description': description,
    'createdOn': createdOn,
  };
}

4.

Insert a new dart file named database_service.dart. This class performs all the database
operations.

import 'dart:developer';
import 'package:demo_sqlite/mood_model.dart';
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

class DatabaseService{
  static final DatabaseService _databaseService = DatabaseService._internal();
  factory DatabaseService() => _databaseService;
  DatabaseService._internal();
  static Database? _database;

  //Get an instance of database
  Future<Database> get database async {
    if (_database != null) return _database!;
    _database = await initDatabase();
    return _database!;
  }

  //Initialize a database
  Future<Database> initDatabase() async {
    final getDirectory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
    String path = '${getDirectory.path}/moods.db';
    log(path);
    return await openDatabase(path, onCreate: _onCreate, version: 1);
  }

    log('TABLE CREATED');
  }

  Future<List<MoodModel>> getMood() async {
    final db = await _databaseService.database;
    var data = await db.query('Moods');
    List<MoodModel> moods =
    List.generate(data.length, (index) => MoodModel.fromJson(data[index]));
    print(moods.length);

    final db = await _databaseService.database;
    var data = await db.rawInsert(
        'INSERT INTO Moods(scale, description) VALUES(?,?)',
        [mood.scale, mood.description]);
    log('inserted $data');
  }

  Future<void> editMood(MoodModel mood) async {
    final db = await _databaseService.database;
    var data = await db.update('Moods', mood.toMap(), where: 'id=?', whereArgs:

}

5.

In the main.dart file, within the Stateful widget class:

//TODO - Declare instance of database service and local variables
final dbService = DatabaseService();
final descriptionController = TextEditingController();
int _scale = 3;

6.

In the main.dart file, within the Stateful widget class, insert a function named
showBottomSheet. This function will prompt a Modal Bottom Sheet, which users can insert
their mood journals.

5.  The URL for accessing the weather Open Data API is

https://developer.data.gov.my/realtime-api/weather

Click the link above to find out more about the API.

6.  Making call to the API, which retrieve 7-day weather for all the states in Malaysia:
https://api.data.gov.my/weather/forecast?contains=St@location__location_id

7.  The data format retrieved from the web server will be in JSON format as follows: -

[
    {
        "location": {
            "location_id": "St001",
            "location_name": "Perlis"
        },
        "date": "2025-02-16",
        "morning_forecast": "Tiada hujan",
        "afternoon_forecast": "Tiada hujan",
        "night_forecast": "Tiada hujan",
        "summary_forecast": "Tiada hujan",
        "summary_when": "Sepanjang Hari",
        "min_temp": 24,
        "max_temp": 33
    },
    {
        "location": {
            "location_id": "St001",
            "location_name": "Perlis"
        },
        "date": "2025-02-15",
        "morning_forecast": "Tiada hujan",
        "afternoon_forecast": "Tiada hujan",

. . .

8.  Create a new dart file named forecast.dart. This class will be used to hold weather records

obtained from the API call.

class Forecast {
  final String date;
  final String morning_forecast;
  final String afternoon_forecast;
  final String night_forecast;
  final String summary_forecast;
  final String summary_when;
  final int min_temp;
  final int max_temp;

  const Forecast({
    required this.date,
    required this.morning_forecast,
    required this.afternoon_forecast,
    required this.night_forecast,
    required this.summary_forecast,
    required this.summary_when,
    required this.min_temp,
    required this.max_temp
  });

  factory Forecast.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return switch (json) {
      {
      'date': String date,
      'morning_forecast': String morning_forecast,
      'afternoon_forecast': String afternoon_forecast,
      'night_forecast': String night_forecast,
      'summary_forecast': String summary_forecast,
      'summary_when': String summary_when,
      'min_temp': int min_temp,
      'max_temp': int max_temp
      } =>
          Forecast(
              date: date,
              morning_forecast: morning_forecast,
              afternoon_forecast: afternoon_forecast,
              night_forecast: night_forecast,
              summary_forecast: summary_forecast,
              summary_when: summary_when,
              min_temp: min_temp,
              max_temp: max_temp
          ),
      _ => throw const FormatException('Failed to load forecast.'),
    };
  }
}

9.

Insert the following images to the assets/images folder.

Cloudy

Haze

Rainy

Sunny

Thunderstorm

10. Open the pubspec.yaml file. Then scroll to the flutter: section. You are to insert a sub-section

named assets:

Page 62 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

Below  the  assets: section, insert – assets/images/. This ensures the app can bundle all the
images in this directory.

11. Open the main.dart file. Within the class _MyHomePageState, insert the following variables and

map:

final Map<String, String> states = {
  ‘St001’: ‘Perlis’,
  ‘St002’: ‘Kedah’,
  ‘St003’: ‘Pulau Pinang’,
  ‘St004’: ‘Perak’,
  ‘St005’: ‘Kelantan’,
  ‘St006’: ‘Terengganu’,
  ‘St007’: ‘Pahang’,
  ‘St008’: ‘Selangor’,
  ‘St009’: ‘WP Kuala Lumpur’,
  ‘St010’: ‘WP Putrajaya’,
  ‘St011’: ‘Negeri Sembilan’,
  ‘St012’: ‘Melaka’,
  ‘St013’: ‘Johor’,
  ‘St501’: ‘Sarawak’,
  ‘St502’: ‘Sabah’,
  ‘St503’: ‘WP Labuan’,
};

String? _selectedState; // Store the selected state
Future<List<Forecast>>? forecastData; // Store the Future

Each state has a unique code with a prefix ‘St’. We declare two variables named _selectedState
and forecastData to hold state code selected by the user and weather forecast data.

12. Within the same class, write a function to perform network request:

Future<List<Forecast>> _fetchForecastData(String locationId) async {
  if (locationId.isEmpty) {
    //Handle empty location ID
    return Future.value([]);
  }

  final url =
Uri.parse('https://api.data.gov.my/weather/forecast?contains=$locationId@location__loca
tion_id&sort=date');

  try {
    final response = await http.get(url);

    if (response.statusCode == 200) {
      // If the server did return a 200 OK response, then parse the JSON.
      final jsonData = jsonDecode(response.body) as List;
      return jsonData.map((json) => Forecast.fromJson(json)).toList();
    } else {
      // If the server did not return a 200 OK response, then throw an exception.
      throw Exception('Failed to load forecast : ${response.statusCode}');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    throw Exception('Error fetching forecast data : $e');

Page 63 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

  }
}

This function will receive a state code (locationId) as an input parameter.

13. Within the build function of the class _MyHomePageState, wrap the Column widget with a

Padding widget as follows:

body: Center(
  child: Padding(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
    child: Column(
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
      children: <Widget>[

   //TODO: Insert a DropdownButton widget

        DropdownButton<String>(
          hint: Text('Select a State'),
          value: _selectedState, // The currently selected value
          iconEnabledColor: Colors.blueAccent,
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(Radius.circular(10.0)),
          elevation: 8,
          items: states.entries.map((entry) {
            return DropdownMenuItem<String>(
              value: entry.key, // Value when selected
              child: Text(entry.value), // Text displayed in the dropdown
            );
          }).toList(),
          onChanged: (String? newValue) {
            if (newValue != null) {
              setState(() {
                _selectedState = newValue; // State code
                forecastData = _fetchForecastData(newValue);
              });
            }
          },
        ),

   //TODO: Insert an Expanded widget

        Expanded(
          child: FutureBuilder<List<Forecast>>(
              future: forecastData,
              builder: (context, snapshot) {
                if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.waiting &&
                    forecastData != null) {
                  return CircularProgressIndicator(
                    strokeAlign: BorderSide.strokeAlignCenter,
                  );
                } else if (snapshot.hasError) {
                  return Text('Error: ${snapshot.error}');
                } else if (snapshot.hasData &&
                    snapshot.data!.isNotEmpty) {
                  return ForecastList(forecastData: snapshot.data!);
                } else {
                  return Text('');
                }
              }),
        ),

   //TODO: Insert a Text widget

        Text('Data Source: Malaysian Meteorological Department'),
      ],
    ),

Page 64 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

The ForecastList is a custom widget that we will insert later.

14. At module level, below the class _MyHomePageState, insert a map for weather status and image

file:

final Map<String, String> weather_status = {
  'Berjerebu': 'haze.png',
  'Tiada hujan': 'sunny.png',
  'Hujan': 'rainy.png',
  'Hujan di beberapa tempat': 'rainy.png',
  'Hujan di satu dua tempat': 'rainy.png',
  'Hujan di satu dua tempat di kawasan pantai': 'rainy.png',
  'Hujan di satu dua tempat di kawasan pedalaman': 'rainy.png',
  'Ribut petir': 'thunderstorm.png',
  'Ribut petir di beberapa tempat': 'thunderstorm.png',
  'Ribut petir di beberapa tempat di kawasan pedalaman  Scattered':
  'thunderstorm.png',
  'Ribut petir di satu dua tempat': 'thunderstorm.png',
  'Ribut petir di satu dua tempat di kawasan pantai': 'thunderstorm.png',
  'Ribut petir di satu dua tempat di kawasan pedalaman': 'thunderstorm.png',
};

15. Next, insert a new stateless widget named ForecastList:

class ForecastList extends StatelessWidget {
  const ForecastList({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Placeholder();
  }
}

16. Declare a variable named forecastData as final and make it a required parameter for the default

constructor:

class ForecastList extends StatelessWidget {
  const ForecastList2({super.key, required this.forecastData});

  final List<Forecast> forecastData;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Placeholder();
  }
}

17. Within the build function, replace the Placeholder with a ListView.builder.

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return ListView.builder(
      itemCount: forecastData.length,
      itemBuilder: (context, index){});
}

Page 65 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

18. Within the itemBuilder function, write the following code:

  return ListView.builder(
        itemCount: forecastData.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          final forecast = forecastData[index];
          return Card(
            color: Colors.white,
            child: ListTile(
              title: Text('${forecast.min_temp}°C  ${forecast.max_temp}°C',),
              leading:
                  Text('${DateFormat('yyyy-MM-dd').parse(forecast.date).day} /
                        ${DateFormat('yyyy-MM-dd').parse(forecast.date).month}',
                      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.grey, fontSize: 20,)),
              subtitle: Row(
                crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
                children: [
                  Column(
                    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                    children: [
                      Text('Morning'),
                      weather_status[forecast.morning_forecast] != null
                          ? Image.asset(

                              width: 48, height: 48,)
                        : Image.asset('assets/images/unknown.png', width: 48, height: 48,),
                    ],
                  ),
                  Expanded(child: SizedBox(),),
                  Column(
                    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                    children: [
                      Text('Afternoon'),
                      weather_status[forecast.afternoon_forecast] != null
                      ? Image.asset(
                 'assets/images/${weather_status[forecast.afternoon_forecast].toString()}',
                         width: 48, height: 48,)
                      : Image.asset('assets/images/unknown.png', width: 48, height: 48,),
                    ],
                  ),
                  Expanded(child: SizedBox(),),
                  Column(
                    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
                    children: [
                      Text('Night'),
                      weather_status[forecast.night_forecast] != null
                          ? Image.asset(
                     'assets/images/${weather_status[forecast.night_forecast].toString()}',
                              width: 48, height: 48,)
                          : Image.asset('assets/images/unknown.png', width: 48, height: 48,
                            ),
                    ],
                  ),
                ],

Open Street Map

OpenStreetMap  (OSM)  is  a  free,  editable  map  of  the  world  that's  created  and  maintained  by
volunteers.  It's  a  collaborative  project  that  uses  open  data  to  create  detailed  maps  of  geographic
locations, landmarks, and more. This lab will create a simple map utilizing OSM with a marker.

1.  Create a new Flutter app using the Empty template named my_osm.
2.  Open the Terminal and get the following dependencies:

flutter pub add flutter_map
flutter pub add  flutter_map_location_marker

3.

In the main.dart file, import the following:

import 'package:flutter_map/flutter_map.dart';
import 'package:latlong2/latlong.dart';

4.  Replace the Text widget with a FlutterMap.

child: FlutterMap(
  options: const MapOptions(
    initialZoom: 10,
    //TODO: Insert latitude and longitude
    initialCenter: const LatLng(3.140853, 101.693207),
  ),
  children: [
    TileLayer(
      maxZoom: 19,
      urlTemplate: 'https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
      userAgentPackageName: 'com.example.demo_openscreetmap',
    ),

    const MarkerLayer(

      markers: [
        Marker(
            point: LatLng(3.140853, 101.693207),
            child: Icon(
              Icons.location_on,
              color: Colors.blue,
            ))
      ],
    )
  ],
),

5.  Save and run your app.

Practical 13:

Location Tracking

1.  We will create an app using location tracking using device GPS or wireless network.

2.

3.

4.

5.

Create a new mobile app using the Application template.

Insert the following dependencies:
  location
  permission_handler

Open the android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml file.  Insert the following permissions.
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <!-- TODO 1 - Insert android permissions -->
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />

 <application ...>

The ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION includes GPS data in reporting user location.
The ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION includes data from the most battery-efficient non-GPS provider
available (for example, the network).

Open the main.dart file. Import the following libraries:
//TODO 2 - Import libraries
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:developer';
import 'package:permission_handler/permission_handler.dart' as handler;
import 'package:location/location.dart';

6.  Within the _MyHomePageState, insert the following:

//TODO 3 - Declare local variables
bool _permissionGranted = false;
bool _gpsEnabled = false;
bool _trackingEnabled = false;
late StreamSubscription _subscription;
final Location _location = Location();
final List<LocationData> _locationList = [];

Page 81 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

7.  Within the _MyHomePageState, create two async methods to check location and GPS

permission status:
//TODO 4 - Check is permission granted
Future<bool> isPermissionGranted() async {
  return await handler.Permission.locationWhenInUse.isGranted;
}

8.

9.

//TODO 5 - Check is GPS enabled
Future<bool> isGpsEnabled() async {
  return await handler.Permission.location.serviceStatus.isEnabled;
}

Insert the checkStatus method, which determines the location and GPS permission status.
//TODO 6 - Check permission status
  void checkStatus() async {
    bool permissionGranted = await isPermissionGranted();
    bool gpsEnabled = await isGpsEnabled();
    setState(() {
      _permissionGranted = permissionGranted;
      _gpsEnabled = gpsEnabled;
    });
  }

Override the initState() method.
//TODO 7 - check status on initialisation
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    checkStatus();
  }

10.  Within the _MyHomePageState, create to async methods that start or end location tracking:

   //TODO 8 - start tracking user's location
  void startTracking() async {
    if (!(await isGpsEnabled())) {
      return;
    }
    if (!(await isPermissionGranted())) {
      return;
    }
    _subscription = _location.onLocationChanged.listen((event) {
      addLocation(event);
    });
    setState(() {
      _trackingEnabled = true;
    });
  }

Page 82 of 85

BMIT2073 Mobile Application Development

Version: 202605

  //TODO 9 - stop tracking user's location
  void stopTracking() {
    _subscription.cancel();
    setState(() {
      _trackingEnabled = false;
    });
    clearLocation();
  }

11.  Override the dispose method. We should stop the location tracking when the app enters the

dispose stage.
  //TODO 10 - stop tracking on dispose
  @override
  void dispose() {
    stopTracking();
    super.dispose();
  }

12.  Within the _MyHomePageState, we may request user permission to enable GPS location

service:
//TODO 11 - Request for GPS
  void requestEnableGps() async {
    if (_gpsEnabled) {
      log("Already open");
    } else {
      bool isGpsActive = await _location.requestService();
      if (!isGpsActive) {
        setState(() {
          _gpsEnabled = false;
        });
        log("User did not turn on GPS");
      } else {
        log("gave permission to the user and opened it");
        setState(() {
          _gpsEnabled = true;
        });
      }
    }
  }

13.  Similarly, we may also request permission to access user’s location:

//TODO 12 - Request location permission
  void requestLocationPermission() async {
    var permissionStatus =
    await handler.Permission.locationWhenInUse.request();

    if (permissionStatus == PermissionStatus.granted) {
      setState(() {
        _permissionGranted = true;
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _permissionGranted = false;
      });
    }
  }

14.  From time to time, location data delivered by location service are inserted to a location list:

  //TODO 13 - Add a new location record to the location list
  void addLocation(LocationData data) {
    setState(() {
      _locationList.insert(0, data);
    });
  }

15.

 When user press the Stop button, we shall clear location data from the location list:
//TODO 14 - Clear the location list
  void clearLocation() {
    setState(() {
      _locationList.clear();
    });
  }

16.  Create a widget to display a location record:

//TODO 15 - Create a list tile template
  ListTile buildListTile(
      String title,
      Widget? trailing,
      ) {
    return ListTile(
      dense: true,
      title: Text(title),
      trailing: trailing,
    );
  }

17.  Within the build method, create the main UI:

//TODO 16 - Create the UI
      body:Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 12),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.max,
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            buildListTile(
              "GPS",
              _gpsEnabled
                  ? const Text("Enabled")
                  : ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    requestEnableGps();
                  },
                  child: const Text("Enable Gps")),
            ),

                  ? const Text("Enabled")
                  : ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    requestLocationPermission();
                  },

                  ? ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {
                    stopTracking();

                  : ElevatedButton(
